                           [23] => "Your moves are weak and your style is a joke. What were you thinking?!"
                           [13] => "I thought that you had at least a little bit of potential! It seems I was wrong!"

                           [37] => "You're not so bad! But you're not so good either! Only average..."
                           [27] => "A thin line separates us. I call it 'talent'."
                           [57] => "I hope Eliza doesn't get mad at me for beating up my brother-in-law like that."
                           [47] => "No matter how many times I see it, your limbs really freak me out, man!"
                           [88] => "Naughty boy! To beat me, you'll need more than flashy moves!"
                           [86] => "So that's what you can do with your 'Iron Body?' How wonderful!"
                           [85] => "The chance to meet interesting people like you is why I can't quit fighting!"
                           [84] => "You must understand the basic rules of fighting!"
                           [82] => "You just keep getting stronger! You may even beat me the next time we fight!"
                           [81] => "It's good to see you're doin' good, kid. Say, have you fought you-know-who yet?"
                           [80] => "Ryu was right. You're a tough customer. But I'm his real rival!"
                           [79] => "Ha! I enjoyed fighting with you. Wanna go another round?"
                           [78] => "Now we know who has the better Shoryuken! This is just the start of my win streak, buddy!"
                           [76] => "I think we've fought too many times now. When will you accept that I'm better?"
                           [75] => "Phew! You almost had me back there. Felt like I was hypnotized or somethin'!"
                           [74] => "Geez, who talks like that? I thought war movies went out of style years ago!"
                           [55] => "I'm the only true 'Man of Flame!' By the way, do you get wet around the middle?"
                           [66] => "If you wanna impersonate me, you'd better remember to include the strength next time!"
                           [65] => "My style's too cool to be copied! Shoryuken! Shoryuken! And Shoryuken!"

                           [32] => "See? The stronger fighter always wins! As easy to understand as a flowchart!"

                           [12] => "The flame of my fist won't be put out so easily!"
                           [62] => "Come to think of it, doesn't your butler usually show up about now?"
                           [72] => "If you want more money, you should first work on figuring out how to save it."
                           [42] => "Ever consider fighting more relaxed? You're even making me feel tense!"
                           [52] => "I've got a long way to fall before I get looked down on by the likes of you."
