                           [73] => "Brute force alone won't beat me! You need to polish your moves!"
                           [83] => "You must defeat Ryu to stand a chance!"
                           [93] => "Gah-haa!"

                           [80] => "Ryu was right. You're a tough customer. But I'm his real rival!"
                           [77] => "It's time you settled down and raised a family. Maybe I'll help you, my friend."

                           [19] => "I will fight with style and finesse, no matter what the outcome may be!"
                           [69] => "For a kid, you sure are tough! I've got high hopes for your Rindo-kan dojo!"
                           [68] => "How many times is this? No worries. I never get tired of kicking your butt."
                           [67] => "Your days as an evil overlord are over! Don't show your face around here again!"
                           [10] => "That was pretty funny! Oh, were you being serious?"
                           [65] => "My style's too cool to be copied! Shoryuken! Shoryuken! And Shoryuken!"
                           [29] => "C'mon! I'll take anyone on! I'll knock you all out one after another!"
                           [9] => "Even by the lowest standards, that was really bad!"
                           [35] => "Say, you're not too shabby! Granted, I still won this one..."
                           [7] => "Washing my boat would've been a better workout!"
                           [6] => "How reckless you are! Don't try to execute a jump-kick on me!"
                           [5] => "You're not bad, but you're not good either."
                           [4] => "Wipe that look off your face, already. You only have yourself to blame!"
                           [3] => "All right! I've got that burning feeling in my fists again!"
                           [64] => "In this world, there are some things you cannot imitate!"
                           [18] => "True strength is something money and credit cards cannot buy!"
                           [89] => "Your Kung Fu is improving, kid. You might become really good... Someday."
                           [99] => "Buffalo, or whatever you're called, you're full of crap!"
                           [95] => "I feel like a man reborn. And now... Now I can never lose!"
                           [59] => "You need to work on your footwork. You’re not going to beat me by just power alone."
                           [75] => "Phew! You almost had me back there. Felt like I was hypnotized or somethin'!"
                           [85] => "The chance to meet interesting people like you is why I can't quit fighting!"

                           [21] => "Maybe my kid should practice sparring with you!"
                           [31] => "The ring is no place for thinking! Your fists should be faster than your brain!"
                           [81] => "It's good to see you're doin' good, kid. Say, have you fought you-know-who yet?"
