                          [65] => "My style's too cool to be copied! Shoryuken! Shoryuken! And Shoryuken!"
                          [64] => "In this world, there are some things you cannot imitate!"

                          [14] => "Go back! I think you left your ego on the battlefield!"
                          [24] => "How was that? Did you feel the power of my Shinryuken?"
                          [40] => "You don't have what it takes to be America's No. 1 fighter!"
                          [50] => "Its not that I dont like dancing. Its just that fighting suits me better."
                          [11] => "It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts!"
                          [18] => "True strength is something money and credit cards cannot buy!"
                          [80] => "Ryu was right. You're a tough customer. But I'm his real rival!"

                          [48] => "You should lose that fake Shoryuken... You'll look like more of a down-to-earth gentleman!"

                          [28] => "Defense will only get you so far against me. You gotta be more aggressive!"
                          [38] => "You may fight like my best friend, but you cannot compare to him!"
                          [17] => "I need a better workout than this! Where's Eliza?!"
                          [62] => "Come to think of it, doesn't your butler usually show up about now?"
                          [60] => "Alright! Alright! I won't treat you like a kid from now on. Happy?"
