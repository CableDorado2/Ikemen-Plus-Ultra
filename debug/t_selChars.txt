                          [76] => "I think we've fought too many times now. When will you accept that I'm better?"
                          [14] => "Go back! I think you left your ego on the battlefield!"
                          [96] => "Y-you're... oooh-waaaaah!!!"

                          [65] => "My style's too cool to be copied! Shoryuken! Shoryuken! And Shoryuken!"
                          [64] => "In this world, there are some things you cannot imitate!"
                          [20] => "Thanks for helping me to show Mel who has the world's strongest fists!"
                          [10] => "That was pretty funny! Oh, were you being serious?"
                          [22] => "Hey, they might make an action figure out of you too, someday!"
                          [21] => "Maybe my kid should practice sparring with you!"
                          [31] => "The ring is no place for thinking! Your fists should be faster than your brain!"
                          [35] => "Say, you're not too shabby! Granted, I still won this one..."
                          [11] => "It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts!"
                          [15] => "In the heat of battle, the blood of the true fighter runs hot!"
                          [25] => "My last name is Masters. That should have been your clue, loser!!"
                          [6] => "How reckless you are! Don't try to execute a jump-kick on me!"
                          [7] => "Washing my boat would've been a better workout!"
                          [8] => "You had no chance against me, but maybe Sean...?"
                          [9] => "Even by the lowest standards, that was really bad!"
                          [81] => "It's good to see you're doin' good, kid. Say, have you fought you-know-who yet?"
                          [91] => "I-is...this... the joy of the powerful...? Heh...heh...heh, heh, heh."
                          [49] => "You gotta be first in Japan before you can be first in the world, pal!"
                          [59] => "You need to work on your footwork. Youre not going to beat me by just power alone."
                          [29] => "C'mon! I'll take anyone on! I'll knock you all out one after another!"
                          [39] => "So this is the Satsui no Hado I've been hearing about. I'll admit, it's no joke!"
                          [63] => "Been too busy with business to keep up your training? Learn how to multi-task, man!"

                          [47] => "No matter how many times I see it, your limbs really freak me out, man!"
