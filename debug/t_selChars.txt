                           [73] => "Brute force alone won't beat me! You need to polish your moves!"
                           [83] => "You must defeat Ryu to stand a chance!"
                           [13] => "I thought that you had at least a little bit of potential! It seems I was wrong!"
                           [23] => "Your moves are weak and your style is a joke. What were you thinking?!"

                           [43] => "Wow, those were some sharp kicks. But when it comes to raw power, mine are stronger."

                           [48] => "You should lose that fake Shoryuken... You'll look like more of a down-to-earth gentleman!"
                           [75] => "Phew! You almost had me back there. Felt like I was hypnotized or somethin'!"

                           [88] => "Naughty boy! To beat me, you'll need more than flashy moves!"
                           [50] => "It’s not that I don’t like dancing. It’s just that fighting suits me better."
                           [40] => "You don't have what it takes to be America's No. 1 fighter!"

                           [24] => "How was that? Did you feel the power of my Shinryuken?"
                           [14] => "Go back! I think you left your ego on the battlefield!"

                           [38] => "You may fight like my best friend, but you cannot compare to him!"
                           [28] => "Defense will only get you so far against me. You gotta be more aggressive!"
                           [18] => "True strength is something money and credit cards cannot buy!"
                           [81] => "It's good to see you're doin' good, kid. Say, have you fought you-know-who yet?"
                           [8] => "You had no chance against me, but maybe Sean...?"
                           [9] => "Even by the lowest standards, that was really bad!"
                           [49] => "You gotta be first in Japan before you can be first in the world, pal!"
                           [7] => "Washing my boat would've been a better workout!"
                           [80] => "Ryu was right. You're a tough customer. But I'm his real rival!"
                           [79] => "Ha! I enjoyed fighting with you. Wanna go another round?"
                           [89] => "Your Kung Fu is improving, kid. You might become really good... Someday."
                           [99] => "Buffalo, or whatever you're called, you're full of crap!"
                           [41] => "I'm sure the jungle is pretty severe, but have you ever tried to take on the corporate world?"

                           [21] => "Maybe my kid should practice sparring with you!"
                           [31] => "The ring is no place for thinking! Your fists should be faster than your brain!"
                           [4] => "Wipe that look off your face, already. You only have yourself to blame!"
                           [45] => "Knocked out already? Dude, are you for real?"
                           [2] => "Well, at least you threw a punch..."
                           [25] => "My last name is Masters. That should have been your clue, loser!!"
                           [74] => "Geez, who talks like that? I thought war movies went out of style years ago!"
                           [3] => "All right! I've got that burning feeling in my fists again!"
                           [71] => "So you're looking for a disciple? Don't make me laugh! You should be my disciple!"
                           [70] => "You're welcome to fight me anytime!! You're fun to beat!"
                           [69] => "For a kid, you sure are tough! I've got high hopes for your Rindo-kan dojo!"
                           [11] => "It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts!"
                           [55] => "I'm the only true 'Man of Flame!' By the way, do you get wet around the middle?"
                           [65] => "My style's too cool to be copied! Shoryuken! Shoryuken! And Shoryuken!"
                           [64] => "In this world, there are some things you cannot imitate!"
                           [15] => "In the heat of battle, the blood of the true fighter runs hot!"
                           [61] => "If you have time to play around here, shouldn't you be taking better care of the Mishima Zaibatsu?"
                           [60] => "Alright! Alright! I won't treat you like a kid from now on. Happy?"
                           [29] => "C'mon! I'll take anyone on! I'll knock you all out one after another!"
                           [39] => "So this is the Satsui no Hado I've been hearing about. I'll admit, it's no joke!"
                           [59] => "You need to work on your footwork. You’re not going to beat me by just power alone."
                           [19] => "I will fight with style and finesse, no matter what the outcome may be!"
                           [56] => "You're not mad at me, are you, Master?"
