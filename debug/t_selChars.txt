                           [69] => "For a kid, you sure are tough! I've got high hopes for your Rindo-kan dojo!"
                           [59] => "You need to work on your footwork. You’re not going to beat me by just power alone."

                           [60] => "Alright! Alright! I won't treat you like a kid from now on. Happy?"
                           [80] => "Ryu was right. You're a tough customer. But I'm his real rival!"
                           [78] => "Now we know who has the better Shoryuken! This is just the start of my win streak, buddy!"
