                           [85] => "The chance to meet interesting people like you is why I can't quit fighting!"
                           [86] => "So that's what you can do with your 'Iron Body?' How wonderful!"
                           [67] => "Your days as an evil overlord are over! Don't show your face around here again!"

                           [43] => "Wow, those were some sharp kicks. But when it comes to raw power, mine are stronger."
                           [53] => "I guess I should be the big star instead of you, huh?"
                           [63] => "Been too busy with business to keep up your training? Learn how to multi-task, man!"
                           [83] => "You must defeat Ryu to stand a chance!"
                           [81] => "It's good to see you're doin' good, kid. Say, have you fought you-know-who yet?"
                           [80] => "Ryu was right. You're a tough customer. But I'm his real rival!"
                           [17] => "I need a better workout than this! Where's Eliza?!"

                           [47] => "No matter how many times I see it, your limbs really freak me out, man!"
                           [57] => "I hope Eliza doesn't get mad at me for beating up my brother-in-law like that."

                           [76] => "I think we've fought too many times now. When will you accept that I'm better?"
                           [75] => "Phew! You almost had me back there. Felt like I was hypnotized or somethin'!"
                           [74] => "Geez, who talks like that? I thought war movies went out of style years ago!"
                           [73] => "Brute force alone won't beat me! You need to polish your moves!"
                           [71] => "So you're looking for a disciple? Don't make me laugh! You should be my disciple!"
                           [13] => "I thought that you had at least a little bit of potential! It seems I was wrong!"
                           [69] => "For a kid, you sure are tough! I've got high hopes for your Rindo-kan dojo!"
                           [8] => "You had no chance against me, but maybe Sean...?"
                           [9] => "Even by the lowest standards, that was really bad!"
                           [6] => "How reckless you are! Don't try to execute a jump-kick on me!"
                           [7] => "Washing my boat would've been a better workout!"
                           [66] => "If you wanna impersonate me, you'd better remember to include the strength next time!"
                           [65] => "My style's too cool to be copied! Shoryuken! Shoryuken! And Shoryuken!"

                           [50] => "It’s not that I don’t like dancing. It’s just that fighting suits me better."
