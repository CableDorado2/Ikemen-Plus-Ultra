                           [29] => "C'mon! I'll take anyone on! I'll knock you all out one after another!"
                           [39] => "So this is the Satsui no Hado I've been hearing about. I'll admit, it's no joke!"
                           [32] => "See? The stronger fighter always wins! As easy to understand as a flowchart!"
                           [22] => "Hey, they might make an action figure out of you too, someday!"
                           [52] => "I've got a long way to fall before I get looked down on by the likes of you."
                           [42] => "Ever consider fighting more relaxed? You're even making me feel tense!"
                           [72] => "If you want more money, you should first work on figuring out how to save it."
                           [62] => "Come to think of it, doesn't your butler usually show up about now?"

                           [20] => "Thanks for helping me to show Mel who has the world's strongest fists!"
                           [84] => "You must understand the basic rules of fighting!"
                           [0] => "Attack me if you dare, I will crush you."
                           [80] => "Ryu was right. You're a tough customer. But I'm his real rival!"
                           [78] => "Now we know who has the better Shoryuken! This is just the start of my win streak, buddy!"
                           [58] => "Don't get me wrong. I really like red. I just don't think it suits a ninja."
                           [12] => "The flame of my fist won't be put out so easily!"
                           [70] => "You're welcome to fight me anytime!! You're fun to beat!"
                           [68] => "How many times is this? No worries. I never get tired of kicking your butt."
                           [28] => "Defense will only get you so far against me. You gotta be more aggressive!"
                           [19] => "I will fight with style and finesse, no matter what the outcome may be!"
                           [97] => "R-Ryu... I-I am.... oooh-waaaaah!!!"
                           [59] => "You need to work on your footwork. You’re not going to beat me by just power alone."
                           [77] => "It's time you settled down and raised a family. Maybe I'll help you, my friend."

                           [3] => "All right! I've got that burning feeling in my fists again!"
                           [2] => "Well, at least you threw a punch..."

                           [23] => "Your moves are weak and your style is a joke. What were you thinking?!"
                           [33] => "Phew! I bet that would make for one exciting replay!"
                           [10] => "That was pretty funny! Oh, were you being serious?"
                           [13] => "I thought that you had at least a little bit of potential! It seems I was wrong!"
