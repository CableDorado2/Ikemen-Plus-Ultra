                           [42] => "Ever consider fighting more relaxed? You're even making me feel tense!"
                           [70] => "You're welcome to fight me anytime!! You're fun to beat!"
                           [10] => "That was pretty funny! Oh, were you being serious?"
                           [66] => "If you wanna impersonate me, you'd better remember to include the strength next time!"

                           [50] => "It’s not that I don’t like dancing. It’s just that fighting suits me better."
                           [29] => "C'mon! I'll take anyone on! I'll knock you all out one after another!"
