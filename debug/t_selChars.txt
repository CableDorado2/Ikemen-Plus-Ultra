                          [48] => "You should lose that fake Shoryuken... You'll look like more of a down-to-earth gentleman!"
                          [38] => "You may fight like my best friend, but you cannot compare to him!"
                          [28] => "Defense will only get you so far against me. You gotta be more aggressive!"
                          [18] => "True strength is something money and credit cards cannot buy!"
                          [64] => "In this world, there are some things you cannot imitate!"
