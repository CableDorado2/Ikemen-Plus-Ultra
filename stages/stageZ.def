; This parameter lets you set the range over which the shadow is
; visible. The first value is the high level, and the second is
; the middle level. Both represent y-coordinates of the player.
; A shadow is invisible if the player is above the high level,
; and fully visible if below the middle level. The shadow is
; faded in between the two levels. This gives an effect of the
; shadow fading away as the player gets farther away from the

; always fully visible).
