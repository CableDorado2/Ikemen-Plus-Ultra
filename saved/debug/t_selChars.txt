                           [48] => "You should lose that fake Shoryuken... You'll look like more of a down-to-earth gentleman!"
                           [38] => "You may fight like my best friend, but you cannot compare to him!"
                           [28] => "Defense will only get you so far against me. You gotta be more aggressive!"

                           [78] => "Now we know who has the better Shoryuken! This is just the start of my win streak, buddy!"
                           [68] => "How many times is this? No worries. I never get tired of kicking your butt."

                           [33] => "Phew! I bet that would make for one exciting replay!"
                           [43] => "Wow, those were some sharp kicks. But when it comes to raw power, mine are stronger."
                           [13] => "I thought that you had at least a little bit of potential! It seems I was wrong!"

                           [9] => "Even by the lowest standards, that was really bad!"
                           [74] => "Geez, who talks like that? I thought war movies went out of style years ago!"
                           [24] => "How was that? Did you feel the power of my Shinryuken?"
                           [70] => "You're welcome to fight me anytime!! You're fun to beat!"
                           [60] => "Alright! Alright! I won't treat you like a kid from now on. Happy?"
