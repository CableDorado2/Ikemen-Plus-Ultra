                           [16] => "Rivalry can often inspire one's skill to become its best!"
                           [26] => "I know you want my autograph. I just don't know where you'd like me to sign!"
                           [64] => "In this world, there are some things you cannot imitate!"
                           [40] => "You don't have what it takes to be America's No. 1 fighter!"
