                         [58] => "Don't get me wrong. I really like red. I just don't think it suits a ninja."
                         [48] => "You should lose that fake Shoryuken... You'll look like more of a down-to-earth gentleman!"

                         [28] => "Defense will only get you so far against me. You gotta be more aggressive!"

                         [19] => "I will fight with style and finesse, no matter what the outcome may be!"

                           [19] => "I will fight with style and finesse, no matter what the outcome may be!"
                           [29] => "C'mon! I'll take anyone on! I'll knock you all out one after another!"
                           [11] => "It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts!"
                           [21] => "Maybe my kid should practice sparring with you!"
