                         [43] => "Wow, those were some sharp kicks. But when it comes to raw power, mine are stronger."

                         [38] => "You may fight like my best friend, but you cannot compare to him!"
                         [68] => "How many times is this? No worries. I never get tired of kicking your butt."
                         [58] => "Don't get me wrong. I really like red. I just don't think it suits a ninja."
                         [60] => "Alright! Alright! I won't treat you like a kid from now on. Happy?"
                         [50] => "It’s not that I don’t like dancing. It’s just that fighting suits me better."

                         [24] => "How was that? Did you feel the power of my Shinryuken?"
                         [54] => "You're one dangerous senior citizen, I'll tell you that!"
                         [44] => "Everyone gets down in the dumps sometimes. I'm sure you'll get over it."

                         [73] => "Brute force alone won't beat me! You need to polish your moves!"
                         [88] => "Naughty boy! To beat me, you'll need more than flashy moves!"
                         [87] => "Take your eyes off the mirror for a second and hit the gym now and then!"
                         [86] => "So that's what you can do with your 'Iron Body?' How wonderful!"
                         [85] => "The chance to meet interesting people like you is why I can't quit fighting!"
                         [84] => "You must understand the basic rules of fighting!"
                         [83] => "You must defeat Ryu to stand a chance!"

                         [81] => "It's good to see you're doin' good, kid. Say, have you fought you-know-who yet?"
                         [80] => "Ryu was right. You're a tough customer. But I'm his real rival!"
                         [79] => "Ha! I enjoyed fighting with you. Wanna go another round?"
                         [78] => "Now we know who has the better Shoryuken! This is just the start of my win streak, buddy!"
                         [77] => "It's time you settled down and raised a family. Maybe I'll help you, my friend."
                         [76] => "I think we've fought too many times now. When will you accept that I'm better?"
                         [75] => "Phew! You almost had me back there. Felt like I was hypnotized or somethin'!"
                         [29] => "C'mon! I'll take anyone on! I'll knock you all out one after another!"
                         [39] => "So this is the Satsui no Hado I've been hearing about. I'll admit, it's no joke!"
                         [35] => "Say, you're not too shabby! Granted, I still won this one..."
                         [45] => "Knocked out already? Dude, are you for real?"
                         [15] => "In the heat of battle, the blood of the true fighter runs hot!"
                         [25] => "My last name is Masters. That should have been your clue, loser!!"
                         [49] => "You gotta be first in Japan before you can be first in the world, pal!"
                         [59] => "You need to work on your footwork. You’re not going to beat me by just power alone."
                         [74] => "Geez, who talks like that? I thought war movies went out of style years ago!"
                         [11] => "It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts!"
                         [89] => "Your Kung Fu is improving, kid. You might become really good... Someday."
                         [99] => "Buffalo, or whatever you're called, you're full of crap!"
                         [41] => "I'm sure the jungle is pretty severe, but have you ever tried to take on the corporate world?"
                         [51] => "Ryu... Is that really you!? What the hell happened? Ryu!"
                         [21] => "Maybe my kid should practice sparring with you!"
                         [31] => "The ring is no place for thinking! Your fists should be faster than your brain!"
                         [71] => "So you're looking for a disciple? Don't make me laugh! You should be my disciple!"
                         [9] => "Even by the lowest standards, that was really bad!"
                         [70] => "You're welcome to fight me anytime!! You're fun to beat!"
                         [69] => "For a kid, you sure are tough! I've got high hopes for your Rindo-kan dojo!"
                         [6] => "How reckless you are! Don't try to execute a jump-kick on me!"
                         [5] => "You're not bad, but you're not good either."
                         [8] => "You had no chance against me, but maybe Sean...?"
                         [7] => "Washing my boat would've been a better workout!"
                         [2] => "Well, at least you threw a punch..."
                         [1] => "Get up!! It's too early for you to be defeated!"
                         [4] => "Wipe that look off your face, already. You only have yourself to blame!"
                         [3] => "All right! I've got that burning feeling in my fists again!"
                         [63] => "Been too busy with business to keep up your training? Learn how to multi-task, man!"
                         [65] => "My style's too cool to be copied! Shoryuken! Shoryuken! And Shoryuken!"

                         [46] => "I'm always up for a rough-and-tumble fight, dude!"
                         [36] => "You should have trained more under Sagat before venturing out on your own."

                           [78] => "Now we know who has the better Shoryuken! This is just the start of my win streak, buddy!"

                           [75] => "Phew! You almost had me back there. Felt like I was hypnotized or somethin'!"
                           [29] => "C'mon! I'll take anyone on! I'll knock you all out one after another!"

                           [35] => "Say, you're not too shabby! Granted, I still won this one..."
                           [45] => "Knocked out already? Dude, are you for real?"
                           [15] => "In the heat of battle, the blood of the true fighter runs hot!"

                           [49] => "You gotta be first in Japan before you can be first in the world, pal!"
                           [59] => "You need to work on your footwork. You’re not going to beat me by just power alone."
                           [74] => "Geez, who talks like that? I thought war movies went out of style years ago!"
                           [11] => "It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts!"
                           [89] => "Your Kung Fu is improving, kid. You might become really good... Someday."
                           [99] => "Buffalo, or whatever you're called, you're full of crap!"
                           [41] => "I'm sure the jungle is pretty severe, but have you ever tried to take on the corporate world?"
                           [51] => "Ryu... Is that really you!? What the hell happened? Ryu!"
                           [21] => "Maybe my kid should practice sparring with you!"
                           [31] => "The ring is no place for thinking! Your fists should be faster than your brain!"
                           [71] => "So you're looking for a disciple? Don't make me laugh! You should be my disciple!"
                           [9] => "Even by the lowest standards, that was really bad!"
                           [70] => "You're welcome to fight me anytime!! You're fun to beat!"
                           [69] => "For a kid, you sure are tough! I've got high hopes for your Rindo-kan dojo!"
                           [6] => "How reckless you are! Don't try to execute a jump-kick on me!"
                           [5] => "You're not bad, but you're not good either."
                           [8] => "You had no chance against me, but maybe Sean...?"
                           [7] => "Washing my boat would've been a better workout!"
                           [2] => "Well, at least you threw a punch..."
                           [1] => "Get up!! It's too early for you to be defeated!"
                           [4] => "Wipe that look off your face, already. You only have yourself to blame!"
                           [3] => "All right! I've got that burning feeling in my fists again!"
                           [63] => "Been too busy with business to keep up your training? Learn how to multi-task, man!"
                           [65] => "My style's too cool to be copied! Shoryuken! Shoryuken! And Shoryuken!"

                           [46] => "I'm always up for a rough-and-tumble fight, dude!"
                           [36] => "You should have trained more under Sagat before venturing out on your own."

                           [16] => "Rivalry can often inspire one's skill to become its best!"
