                           [86] => "So that's what you can do with your 'Iron Body?' How wonderful!"
                           [9] => "Even by the lowest standards, that was really bad!"

                           [73] => "Brute force alone won't beat me! You need to polish your moves!"
                           [72] => "If you want more money, you should first work on figuring out how to save it."
                           [71] => "So you're looking for a disciple? Don't make me laugh! You should be my disciple!"

                           [29] => "C'mon! I'll take anyone on! I'll knock you all out one after another!"
                           [59] => "You need to work on your footwork. You’re not going to beat me by just power alone."
                           [49] => "You gotta be first in Japan before you can be first in the world, pal!"
                           [11] => "It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts!"
                           [35] => "Say, you're not too shabby! Granted, I still won this one..."
                           [31] => "The ring is no place for thinking! Your fists should be faster than your brain!"
                           [21] => "Maybe my kid should practice sparring with you!"
                           [51] => "Ryu... Is that really you!? What the hell happened? Ryu!"

                           [85] => "The chance to meet interesting people like you is why I can't quit fighting!"
                           [75] => "Phew! You almost had me back there. Felt like I was hypnotized or somethin'!"
