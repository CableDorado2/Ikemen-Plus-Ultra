                           [35] => "Say, you're not too shabby! Granted, I still won this one..."
                           [45] => "Knocked out already? Dude, are you for real?"
                           [61] => "If you have time to play around here, shouldn't you be taking better care of the Mishima Zaibatsu?"
                           [25] => "My last name is Masters. That should have been your clue, loser!!"
                           [11] => "It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts!"
                           [96] => "Y-you're... oooh-waaaaah!!!"
                           [50] => "Its not that I dont like dancing. Its just that fighting suits me better."
                           [40] => "You don't have what it takes to be America's No. 1 fighter!"
                           [30] => "I know what you wanna say, 'You're so cool! You rock!' That's it, right?"
                           [20] => "Thanks for helping me to show Mel who has the world's strongest fists!"
                           [44] => "Everyone gets down in the dumps sometimes. I'm sure you'll get over it."
                           [34] => "You know my moves, don't you? Why'd you just walk into 'em like that?"
                           [24] => "How was that? Did you feel the power of my Shinryuken?"
                           [14] => "Go back! I think you left your ego on the battlefield!"
                           [38] => "You may fight like my best friend, but you cannot compare to him!"
                           [28] => "Defense will only get you so far against me. You gotta be more aggressive!"
                           [18] => "True strength is something money and credit cards cannot buy!"
                           [10] => "That was pretty funny! Oh, were you being serious?"
                           [68] => "How many times is this? No worries. I never get tired of kicking your butt."
                           [58] => "Don't get me wrong. I really like red. I just don't think it suits a ninja."
                           [48] => "You should lose that fake Shoryuken... You'll look like more of a down-to-earth gentleman!"
                           [98] => "Heh, lots of women find me disturbing."
                           [88] => "Naughty boy! To beat me, you'll need more than flashy moves!"
                           [83] => "You must defeat Ryu to stand a chance!"
                           [97] => "R-Ryu... I-I am.... oooh-waaaaah!!!"
                           [90] => "You're still having trouble with Hadokens? Man, how many years has it been?"

                           [95] => "I feel like a man reborn. And now... Now I can never lose!"
                           [84] => "You must understand the basic rules of fighting!"
                           [8] => "You had no chance against me, but maybe Sean...?"
                           [33] => "Phew! I bet that would make for one exciting replay!"
                           [43] => "Wow, those were some sharp kicks. But when it comes to raw power, mine are stronger."
                           [53] => "I guess I should be the big star instead of you, huh?"
                           [63] => "Been too busy with business to keep up your training? Learn how to multi-task, man!"
                           [27] => "A thin line separates us. I call it 'talent'."
                           [37] => "You're not so bad! But you're not so good either! Only average..."
                           [47] => "No matter how many times I see it, your limbs really freak me out, man!"
                           [29] => "C'mon! I'll take anyone on! I'll knock you all out one after another!"
                           [39] => "So this is the Satsui no Hado I've been hearing about. I'll admit, it's no joke!"
                           [87] => "Take your eyes off the mirror for a second and hit the gym now and then!"
                           [19] => "I will fight with style and finesse, no matter what the outcome may be!"
                           [69] => "For a kid, you sure are tough! I've got high hopes for your Rindo-kan dojo!"
                           [79] => "Ha! I enjoyed fighting with you. Wanna go another round?"
                           [49] => "You gotta be first in Japan before you can be first in the world, pal!"
                           [59] => "You need to work on your footwork. Youre not going to beat me by just power alone."
                           [86] => "So that's what you can do with your 'Iron Body?' How wonderful!"
                           [85] => "The chance to meet interesting people like you is why I can't quit fighting!"
                           [89] => "Your Kung Fu is improving, kid. You might become really good... Someday."
                           [99] => "Buffalo, or whatever you're called, you're full of crap!"
                           [82] => "You just keep getting stronger! You may even beat me the next time we fight!"
                           [81] => "It's good to see you're doin' good, kid. Say, have you fought you-know-who yet?"
                           [80] => "Ryu was right. You're a tough customer. But I'm his real rival!"
                           [78] => "Now we know who has the better Shoryuken! This is just the start of my win streak, buddy!"
                           [77] => "It's time you settled down and raised a family. Maybe I'll help you, my friend."
                           [76] => "I think we've fought too many times now. When will you accept that I'm better?"
                           [75] => "Phew! You almost had me back there. Felt like I was hypnotized or somethin'!"
                           [74] => "Geez, who talks like that? I thought war movies went out of style years ago!"
                           [73] => "Brute force alone won't beat me! You need to polish your moves!"
                           [72] => "If you want more money, you should first work on figuring out how to save it."
                           [71] => "So you're looking for a disciple? Don't make me laugh! You should be my disciple!"
                           [94] => "More... oooh! I-I seek...more powerful opponents...ooh-aah!"
                           [32] => "See? The stronger fighter always wins! As easy to understand as a flowchart!"
                           [22] => "Hey, they might make an action figure out of you too, someday!"
                           [52] => "I've got a long way to fall before I get looked down on by the likes of you."
                           [42] => "Ever consider fighting more relaxed? You're even making me feel tense!"
                           [26] => "I know you want my autograph. I just don't know where you'd like me to sign!"
                           [16] => "Rivalry can often inspire one's skill to become its best!"
                           [46] => "I'm always up for a rough-and-tumble fight, dude!"
                           [36] => "You should have trained more under Sagat before venturing out on your own."
                           [67] => "Your days as an evil overlord are over! Don't show your face around here again!"
                           [66] => "If you wanna impersonate me, you'd better remember to include the strength next time!"
                           [65] => "My style's too cool to be copied! Shoryuken! Shoryuken! And Shoryuken!"
                           [64] => "In this world, there are some things you cannot imitate!"
                           [23] => "Your moves are weak and your style is a joke. What were you thinking?!"
                           [9] => "Even by the lowest standards, that was really bad!"
                           [12] => "The flame of my fist won't be put out so easily!"
                           [21] => "Maybe my kid should practice sparring with you!"
                           [17] => "I need a better workout than this! Where's Eliza?!"
                           [15] => "In the heat of battle, the blood of the true fighter runs hot!"
                           [62] => "Come to think of it, doesn't your butler usually show up about now?"
                           [13] => "I thought that you had at least a little bit of potential! It seems I was wrong!"
                           [60] => "Alright! Alright! I won't treat you like a kid from now on. Happy?"
                           [57] => "I hope Eliza doesn't get mad at me for beating up my brother-in-law like that."
                           [56] => "You're not mad at me, are you, Master?"
                           [54] => "You're one dangerous senior citizen, I'll tell you that!"
                           [0] => "Attack me if you dare, I will crush you."
                           [1] => "Get up!! It's too early for you to be defeated!"
                           [2] => "Well, at least you threw a punch..."
                           [3] => "All right! I've got that burning feeling in my fists again!"
                           [4] => "Wipe that look off your face, already. You only have yourself to blame!"
                           [5] => "You're not bad, but you're not good either."
                           [6] => "How reckless you are! Don't try to execute a jump-kick on me!"
                           [7] => "Washing my boat would've been a better workout!"
