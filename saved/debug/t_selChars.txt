                           [73] => "Brute force alone won't beat me! You need to polish your moves!"

                           [66] => "If you wanna impersonate me, you'd better remember to include the strength next time!"
                           [65] => "My style's too cool to be copied! Shoryuken! Shoryuken! And Shoryuken!"

                           [17] => "I need a better workout than this! Where's Eliza?!"
                           [27] => "A thin line separates us. I call it 'talent'."

                           [10] => "That was pretty funny! Oh, were you being serious?"
                           [60] => "Alright! Alright! I won't treat you like a kid from now on. Happy?"
                           [59] => "You need to work on your footwork. You’re not going to beat me by just power alone."
                           [92] => "I won... b-but...ooooh... oo-gaaaaaah!!!"
                           [82] => "You just keep getting stronger! You may even beat me the next time we fight!"

                           [53] => "I guess I should be the big star instead of you, huh?"
                           [52] => "I've got a long way to fall before I get looked down on by the likes of you."

                           [17] => "I need a better workout than this! Where's Eliza?!"
                           [27] => "A thin line separates us. I call it 'talent'."

                           [10] => "That was pretty funny! Oh, were you being serious?"
                           [60] => "Alright! Alright! I won't treat you like a kid from now on. Happy?"
                           [59] => "You need to work on your footwork. You’re not going to beat me by just power alone."
                           [92] => "I won... b-but...ooooh... oo-gaaaaaah!!!"
                           [82] => "You just keep getting stronger! You may even beat me the next time we fight!"

                           [43] => "Wow, those were some sharp kicks. But when it comes to raw power, mine are stronger."
                           [36] => "You should have trained more under Sagat before venturing out on your own."
