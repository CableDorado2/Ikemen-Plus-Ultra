                         [59] => "You need to work on your footwork. You’re not going to beat me by just power alone."
                         [21] => "Maybe my kid should practice sparring with you!"
                         [11] => "It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts!"
                         [29] => "C'mon! I'll take anyone on! I'll knock you all out one after another!"
                         [19] => "I will fight with style and finesse, no matter what the outcome may be!"

                         [81] => "It's good to see you're doin' good, kid. Say, have you fought you-know-who yet?"
                         [71] => "So you're looking for a disciple? Don't make me laugh! You should be my disciple!"

                         [48] => "You should lose that fake Shoryuken... You'll look like more of a down-to-earth gentleman!"
                         [18] => "True strength is something money and credit cards cannot buy!"
                         [28] => "Defense will only get you so far against me. You gotta be more aggressive!"

                         [33] => "Phew! I bet that would make for one exciting replay!"
                         [23] => "Your moves are weak and your style is a joke. What were you thinking?!"
                         [13] => "I thought that you had at least a little bit of potential! It seems I was wrong!"

                         [73] => "Brute force alone won't beat me! You need to polish your moves!"

                         [53] => "I guess I should be the big star instead of you, huh?"
                         [43] => "Wow, those were some sharp kicks. But when it comes to raw power, mine are stronger."
                         [47] => "No matter how many times I see it, your limbs really freak me out, man!"
                         [37] => "You're not so bad! But you're not so good either! Only average..."
                         [27] => "A thin line separates us. I call it 'talent'."
                         [17] => "I need a better workout than this! Where's Eliza?!"

                         [88] => "Naughty boy! To beat me, you'll need more than flashy moves!"
                         [87] => "Take your eyes off the mirror for a second and hit the gym now and then!"
                         [65] => "My style's too cool to be copied! Shoryuken! Shoryuken! And Shoryuken!"
                         [85] => "The chance to meet interesting people like you is why I can't quit fighting!"
                         [84] => "You must understand the basic rules of fighting!"
                         [83] => "You must defeat Ryu to stand a chance!"
                         [82] => "You just keep getting stronger! You may even beat me the next time we fight!"
                         [79] => "Ha! I enjoyed fighting with you. Wanna go another round?"
                         [78] => "Now we know who has the better Shoryuken! This is just the start of my win streak, buddy!"
                         [77] => "It's time you settled down and raised a family. Maybe I'll help you, my friend."
                         [76] => "I think we've fought too many times now. When will you accept that I'm better?"
                         [75] => "Phew! You almost had me back there. Felt like I was hypnotized or somethin'!"
                         [74] => "Geez, who talks like that? I thought war movies went out of style years ago!"
                         [72] => "If you want more money, you should first work on figuring out how to save it."
                         [69] => "For a kid, you sure are tough! I've got high hopes for your Rindo-kan dojo!"
                         [68] => "How many times is this? No worries. I never get tired of kicking your butt."
                         [67] => "Your days as an evil overlord are over! Don't show your face around here again!"
                         [66] => "If you wanna impersonate me, you'd better remember to include the strength next time!"
                         [32] => "See? The stronger fighter always wins! As easy to understand as a flowchart!"
                         [4] => "Wipe that look off your face, already. You only have yourself to blame!"
                         [26] => "I know you want my autograph. I just don't know where you'd like me to sign!"
                         [36] => "You should have trained more under Sagat before venturing out on your own."

                         [86] => "So that's what you can do with your 'Iron Body?' How wonderful!"
                         [96] => "Y-you're... oooh-waaaaah!!!"
                         [15] => "In the heat of battle, the blood of the true fighter runs hot!"
