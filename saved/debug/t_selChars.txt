                         [60] => "Alright! Alright! I won't treat you like a kid from now on. Happy?"
                         [17] => "I need a better workout than this! Where's Eliza?!"

                         [28] => "Defense will only get you so far against me. You gotta be more aggressive!"
                         [38] => "You may fight like my best friend, but you cannot compare to him!"
                         [48] => "You should lose that fake Shoryuken... You'll look like more of a down-to-earth gentleman!"
                         [58] => "Don't get me wrong. I really like red. I just don't think it suits a ninja."

                           [28] => "Defense will only get you so far against me. You gotta be more aggressive!"

                           [48] => "You should lose that fake Shoryuken... You'll look like more of a down-to-earth gentleman!"
                           [58] => "Don't get me wrong. I really like red. I just don't think it suits a ninja."
