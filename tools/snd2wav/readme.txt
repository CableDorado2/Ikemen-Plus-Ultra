This software extracts wav files from MUGEN's snd.

- System Requirements
It should work on any Windows system. This has not been tested.

No special steps are required.

- Uninstall

you can simply delete the file if it is no longer needed.

- How to Use (snd2wav)
Drag and drop the snd file into snd2wav.

When using from the command prompt:
> snd2wav kfm.snd outputdir
This will create a wav file in the outputdir folder, and a list of the files will be written to the kfm.txt file.
kfm.txt can be used with sndmaker.
