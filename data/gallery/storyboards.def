;   If is not defined, "art.offset" system.def [ArtViewer Info] paramvalue will be used.

; - scale (only used in artwork viewer)
; 	Set scaleX and scaleY for sprite defined in spr paramvalue.
;   If is not defined, "art.scale" system.def [ArtViewer Info] paramvalue will be used.

; - zoomlimit (only used in artwork viewer)
; 	Set maxZoomOut and maxZoomIn for sprite defined in spr paramvalue.
;   If is not defined, "art.zoomlimit" system.def [ArtViewer Info] paramvalue will be used.

; - movelimit (only used in artwork viewer)
; 	Set maxPosX1, maxPosY1, maxPosX2, maxPosY2 for sprite defined in spr paramvalue.
;   If is not defined, "art.movelimit" system.def [ArtViewer Info] paramvalue will be used.

; - previewpos (only used in main gallery screen)
; 	Set posX and posY for gallery preview sprite which is the same defined in spr paramvalue.
;   If is not defined, "preview.art.offset" system.def [Gallery Info] paramvalue will be used.

;Note:
;It is recommended not to use some paramvalues ​​in this file for those images that share the same size/dimensions.
;In the examples above, items 4, 5, and 6 share the same dimensions, so instead of adding custom values for each (except: id, spr, info and unlock)
;the COMMON VALUES are read from system.def according to the description of what happens "if not defined".
