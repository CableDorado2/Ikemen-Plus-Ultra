This file contains list of all available parameters and the default
values used by select definition file.

This file IS NOT loaded by engine and should not be used as-is. It's meant to
be a reference for adding parameters to your own select.def file.

 ____________________
/    CHARACTERS      \_____________________________________________________

Use the format: charname, stagefilename1, stagefilename2, ...
below "[Characters]" section.

eg. For a player with filename "kfm" and stage filename "stages/mybg.def"
type (without the semicolon): kfm, stages/mybg.def

There can be more than 1 stage assigned to character.
In such case stage will be randomly chosen.

If you want to load a different def file, you can enter it
as a directory plus the def file. This example loads up
chars/kfm/alt-kfm.def:kfm/alt-kfm.def, stages/mybg.def

If you put "random" as the stagefilename, then a random stage will
be selected for that player. But not really needed since no stage = random anyway.
kfm, random

Optional parameters may follow on the same line, separated
by commas. Each parameter has the form: paramname = paramvalue
where paramname is the name of the parameter type, and
paramvalue is the value to assign that parameter.


The optional parameters are:

- music
Set the paramvalue to the name of the music file to use
as the BGM for that character. This overrides the bgmusic
parameter in the stage's .def file, so you can re-use the
same stage for multiple characters, but have a different
BGM playing for each person.

There can be more than 1 music parameter set for stage.
In such case track will be randomly chosen.

- zoom
Set the paramvalue to 0 to avoid stage zoom
even if it is enabled globally. Useful for characters that 
don't work well with zoom (for example bonus characters)

- training
Set the paramvalue to 1 to predefined this character as a training char.
If more than 1 character have setting training parameter
the training character will be randomly chosen.

- bonus
Set the paramvalue to 1 to include this
character in "Bonus Games" mode. Bonus characters also
won't show up as Simul team if faced in arcade mode.

- boss
Set the paramvalue to 1 to include this
character in "Boss Rush" mode.

- intermission
Set the paramvalue to 1 to include this character in
arcade intermission chars (currently works in credits screen).
If more than 1 character have setting intermission parameter
the intermission character will be randomly chosen.

- ai
Set the paramvalue between 0 and 8 to force
AI Level regardless of difficulty and AI ramping settings.

- vsscreen
Set the paramvalue to 0 to avoid displaying versus screen
when facing this character.

- victoryscreen
Set the paramvalue to 0 to avoid displaying
victory screen after beating this character.

- rounds
Set the paramvalue to the number of rounds in order to
overwrite rounds number chosen in settings (Useful for Bonus Characters).

- roundtime
Set the paramvalue to the time (in seconds) in order to
overwrite round time saved in settings.

- single
Set the paramvalue to 1 to force facing this character
individually in arcade team modes.

- includestage
Set the paramvalue to 0 to avoid including this stage
in the stage select list (in VS, training modes, etc)

- exclude
Set the paramvalue to 1 to avoid including
this character when player choose 'random' character icon.
Also excludes character to be chosen by CPU in modes other
than arcade (arcade selection is controlled by 'order')

- excludetourney (Experimental)
Set the paramvalue to 1 to avoid including this character
when some tourney participant slots have not been set manually
and character is chosen randomly.

- unlock
Paramvalue is executed as Lua code condition, right after
new game mode is initiated and upon returning to main menu.
If it evaluates to boolean 'true' the character locked via 'hidden'
parameter will become selectable. On 'false' it will be hidden.
Due to parameters syntax, 'unlock' is recommended to be the last parameter
used in line (everything that follows is treated as a pure Lua code).
Default: true (if character is not hidden, otherwise: false)

- order
Set the paramvalue to the ordering priority to give the
character in arcade mode (1 by default). A smaller value
means you will fight the character sooner. You will never
fight an order 2 character before an order 1 character,
and never an order 3 character before an order 2 one.
For example, you might want to set your boss character
to have order=3. The default order value is 1 if you omit
this param. See *.maxmatches under [Options] for how to
limit the number of matches per order priority.
Max 30 orders MUGEN limitation is lifted.

- 1, 2, (...)
Paramname points to the match number in arcade mode.
Paramvalue overwrites character that you would face
following normal 'order'. Paramvalue should match exactly
the charname text typed after "Insert your characters below"
line, so it can be either full DEF path or just folder name.
This functionality introduces simple solution for implementing
arcade paths similar to the one in Street Fighter Alpha 3
where characters always face their rivals along the way.
If you're playing in Team mode than paramvalue character becomes
opposite team leader, other characters follow normal order.

You can also add a randomize icon to the select screen. To do
this, put the word "randomselect" on a line of its own, with no
extra parameters.

Insert "stages/mybg.def" below "[ExtraStages]" section.
Optional parameters may follow on the same line, separated
by commas. Each parameter has the form: paramname = paramvalue
where paramname is the name of the parameter type, and
paramvalue is the value to assign that parameter.

The optional parameters are:

- music
Set the paramvalue to the name of the music
file to use as the BGM for the stage. If bgmusic parameter
in the stage's .def file is also present than engine will
pick one of the tracks randomly. On top of that there can
be more than 1 music parameter assigned here.

- zoom
Set the paramvalue to 0 to avoid stage zoom
even if it is enabled globally. And the other way around.

- zoomMin
Set the paramvalue to overwrite global
maximum zoom out setting for this particular stage.

- zoomMax
Set the paramvalue to overwrite global
maximum zoom in setting for this particular stage.

- zoomSpeed
Set the paramvalue to overwrite global
zoom speed setting for this particular stage.

- unlock
Paramvalue is executed as Lua code condition, right after
new game mode is initiated and upon returning to main menu.
If it evaluates to boolean 'true' the stage locked via 'hidden'
parameter will become selectable. On 'false' it will be hidden.
Due to parameters syntax, 'unlock' is recommended to be the last parameter
used in line (everything that follows is treated as a pure Lua code).
Default: true (if stage is not hidden, otherwise: false)

Some examples:

[ExtraStages]

stages/mybg.def, zoom=0
stages/mybg.def, zoom=1, zoomMin=0.75, zoomMax=1.1, zoomSpeed=1

 ____________________
/    MATCH CONFIG    \_____________________________________________________

All parameters need to be added below "[Options]" section.

- arcade.maxmatches
Here you set the maximum number of matches to fight before game ends
in Arcade Mode. The first number is the number of matches against
characters with order=1, followed by order=2 and order=3 respectively.
For example, for 4,3,1 you will fight up to 4 randomly-picked
characters who have order=1, followed by 3 with order=2 and 1 with
order=3.

Max 30 orders limitation from MUGEN is lifted.

Some examples:
arcade.maxmatches = 6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
arcade.maxmatches = 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
arcade.maxmatches = 2,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,2,1

- team.maxmatches
Set maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in Team Mode.
Like arcade.maxmatches, but applies to Team Battle.

Example:
team.maxmatches = 2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

- AIramp
AI ramping settings has been moved here from mugen.cfg
You can view AI ramping output for all battles from the last chosen mode
via save/debug/t_aiRamp.txt (useful reference also for vanilla mugen).

Arcade Mode AI ramping. For both parameters below, the first number
corresponds to the number of matches won, and the second number to the
AI difficulty offset. The actual difficulty is the sum of the AI
difficulty level (set in the options menu) and the value of the offset
at a particular match.

<gamemode>.AIramp.start = start_match, start_diff
<gamemode>.AIramp.end   = end_match, end_diff

The difficulty offset function is a constant value of start_diff from
the first match until start_match matches have been won. From then the
offset value increases linearly from start_diff to end_diff. After
end_diff matches have been won, the offset value is end_diff.

 ;  e_d            /----------

 ;  s_d _______/
 ;     ^      ^     ^        ^
 ;   1st_m   s_m   e_m     last_m

At the moment only arcade,team arcade and survival are available to use AIramp.

Single Mode AI ramping Example:
arcade.AIramp.start = 2, 0
arcade.AIramp.end   = 4, 2
;For 6 matches at level 4, the difficulty will be (by match): 4,4,4,5,6,6

Team Mode AI ramping Example:
team.AIramp.start = 1, 0
team.AIramp.end   = 3, 2
;For 4 matches at level 4 and default values, the difficulty will be: 4,4,5,6

Survival Mode AI ramping Example:
survival.AIramp.start = 0, -3
survival.AIramp.end   = 16, 4
;For 16 matches at level 4 and default values, the difficulty will be: 1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8

Full Example:

[Options]
arcade.maxmatches = 1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
team.maxmatches = 1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

arcade.AIramp.start = 2, 0
arcade.AIramp.end   = 4, 2

team.AIramp.start = 1, 0
team.AIramp.end   = 3, 2

survival.AIramp.start = 0, -3
survival.AIramp.end   = 16, 4
