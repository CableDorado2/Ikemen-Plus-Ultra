=====<MOVE DETAILS>=====

 - Head Press can be used as a pursuit attack, to hit downed opponents

 - Somersault Skull Diver and Devil Reverse can be manually steered with the forward and backward directions

 - Psycho Banish can destroy projectiles

 - Strenth of Vega Warp determines how far from his starting position he will end up

 - If you fire a Psycho Field and get hit before it explodes, Vega loses control over it and
the projectile dissipates without harming the opponent;

 - Psycho Crusher and Nightmare Booster destroy normal projectiles. Psycho Break Smasher
destroys normal and special projectiles. Final Psycho Crusher destroys any projectile



=====<GAMEPLAY NOTES>=====

COMBO SYSTEM
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Super moves can be canceled into other Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points


DAMAGE SCALING
 - The damage your attacks inflict goes down as the total combo damage goes up
 - At 0 combo damage, they deal full damage
 - At 500 combo damage, they deal the minimum 10% damage


COUNTER HITS
 - If the opponent is in the middle of attacking, your attacks deal 20% extra damage
 - Normal attacks cause extra hit stun as well, allowing links that are normally not possible
 - You'll know a counter hit happened when a round shockwave effect appears at the point of impact


FORWARD DASH
 - Moves you forward faster than walking, but you can't interrupt it
 - Useful for sneaking up on the opponent


RUN
 - Can be interrupted unlike dashes


BACK DASH
 - Creates some space between you and the opponent
 - Considered airborne, so it avoids most throws and standing combos


LOW JUMP
 - Useful for quick jumping attacks that must be blocked high
 - Cannot use special and super moves while low jumping
 - Delay after attacking is longer than other jumps


HIGH JUMP
 - Useful for quickly closing distance
 - If the opponent is in the corner, this allows you to cross him up


LONG LOW JUMP
 - A cross between Low and High jumps


SIDESTEP
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Instant recovery


SIDESTEP ATTACK
 - Allows you to counterattack after dodging
 - Between the punch and kick options, one can be cancelled into special and super moves, and the other knocks down


ROLL
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs while moving
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Can be hit by anything at the end of the animation
 - Forward version is a bit faster than the back version


PARRY
 - Allows you to bypass block stun, leaving the opponent open for a counterattack
 - To parry high attacks tap forward just before being hit. To parry low attacks tap down. While jumping only forward works


POWER CHARGE
 - Manually charges the power meter
 - Rate of charge is slow at first, but increases the longer you hold it


GUARD CANCEL
 - While guarding, this cancels out of the guarding pose with a counterattack
 - Useful to relieve pressure


CUSTOM COMBO
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start


FALL RECOVERY
 - Allows you to land on your feet after being knocked down
