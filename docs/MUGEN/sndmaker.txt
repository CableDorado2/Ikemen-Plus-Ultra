Sndmaker is used to generate sound (.snd) files. The way Sndmaker
works is almost exactly like sprmaker.  Again, it's best to redirect
its input from a text file.

The format is the same as sprmaker minus the palette options and such.
Also, you don't need an X and Y axis.  

  chars/test/test.snd
  work/test/mysound.wav
  0 
  0
  work/test/mysound2.wav
  0
  1


If this file was saved as work/test/sound.txt, then you would type this
at the command line:

sndmaker < work\test\sound.txt
