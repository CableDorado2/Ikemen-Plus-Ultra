text:
Often abbreviated to KFM is the very first
M.U.G.E.N character ever made and comes
pre-installed with all versions of the
M.U.G.E.N engine when downloaded from
Elecbyte's website.
°
Kung Fu Man's story begins with himself
and his girlfriend going for a walk.
Sometime during this walk, they are
ambushed by Suave Dude and his minions.
Kung Fu Man fends off Suave Dude's minions
though while he is preoccupied, Suave Dude
captures Kung Fu Man's girlfriend and
retreats back to his secret hideout.
In order to get his girlfriend back
Kung Fu Man sets off for Suave Dude's
hideout letting nothing stand in his way.
°
In M.U.G.E.N, Kung Fu Man has been made
four times by Elecbyte, the creators of
M.U.G.E.N.
All four versions are fundamentally the
same, using simple attacks based around
Chinese martial arts and presumably original
sound effects; each version highlights some
of the new features of an engine version that
weren't present in previous versions, such
as the third and fourth versions using
localcoord, a feature introduced in
M.U.G.E.N 1.0.
°
Due to the character's nature as a template
many edits of Kung Fu Man exist that change
his gameplay, moveset and/or even his name.

displayname = Suave Dude
text:
A character that serves as the main antagonist
of M.U.G.E.N's Arcade mode.
He is a rich man who looks rather suave and
sophisticated; wearing blue jeans, a black shirt
and a pair of sunglasses, and lives in the
Mountainside Temple with many minions
(presumably the characters in the player's
M.U.G.E.N roster).
He is the mortal enemy of Kung Fu Man and the
would-be final boss of M.U.G.E.N should Elecbyte
ever make the Suave Dude character.
°
Long before he served any real purpose
Suave Dude originally appeared in an example image
for PCXClean to illustrate its functions, but was
seemingly wiped from existence within seconds
with only Kung Fu Man left standing.
What truly happened to Suave Dude remains a mystery
but he reappeared a few years later to kidnap
Kung Fu Man's Girlfriend, only to disappear once
Kung Fu Man arrives at his temple and defeats
an evil clone of himself.
°
While only the Suave Dude sprite exists, it was
originally kept as a tradition by many M.U.G.E.N
fans to never make a Suave Dude character in order
to keep Kung Fu Man's ending "true".
Despite this however, various creators have created
their own interpretations of Suave Dude
most notably Masukenpu-kun's version.

displayname = Kung Fu Girl
text:
A female version of Kung Fu Man.
She is a young woman with a busty upper body
and red hair.
°
Kung Fu Girl shares some similarities to
Kung Fu Man like performing some of his signature
moves such as Kung Fu Palm and so on.
Unlike Kung Fu Man, however, she has some unique
abilities such as being able to produce a chibi
ghost version of herself as a projectile, the ability
to stretch her arm long distances, and to release a
powerful energy blast covering the whole screen.
She also has a certain passion for disguises.

displayname = Evil Kung Fu Man
text:
An evil android version of Kung Fu Man who is under
the control of KFM's arch nemesis, Suave Dude.
Originally, there was no Evil KFM around until
this version made by Most_Mysterious came.
Since his release he has had some
major updates by The_None.
°
Going by Kung Fu Man's Arcade mode story
Evil Kung Fu Man would be the last opponent
Kung Fu Man faces before Suave Dude.

displayname = Mountainside Temple
text:
The secret hideout of Suave Dude located somewhere
in a mountainous region. Kung Fu Man sets out on
a journey to reach the temple in an effort to defeat
the evil Suave Dude and rescue his kidnapped girlfriend.
In Evil Kung Fu Man's Arcade intro, it was featured as
the destination where Kung Fu Man was repelled by
his evil clone while searching for Suave Dude.
°
In M.U.G.E.N, Mountainside Temple has been made
by Elecbyte and is one of two default stages that comes
with pre-installed with an official M.U.G.E.N download
the other being Training Room.
°
Elecbyte's Mountainside Temple has combatants fight
inside the titular temple, with the mountainous region
where the temple is located being visible through
various windows and openings in the rear wall.
The temple itself is mostly constructed out of wood
with the only non-wooden parts of its construction being
stone pillars that are placed at regular intervals alongside
the rear wall. While each new version of the M.U.G.E.N engine
comes bundled with a new variant of the stage, its appearance
has remained relatively unchanged since its creation in
the late 20th century, though the variant that comes with
M.U.G.E.N 1.1 has slightly brighter colours than its
predecessors; for some inexplicable reason known only to
Elecbyte, any particular variant of the stage that comes
with a download of the engine is incompatible with older
versions of the engine though no such limitations occur when
using an older iteration of the stage with a newer version
of the engine.
°
Similar to the creators' Training Room stage
Mountainside Temple isn't overly wide and lacks any
real height, as the camera barely has to scroll much distance
vertically before it's prevented from going any further.

displayname = Training Room
text:
One of two default stages included with an official
M.U.G.E.N download from Elecbyte's webpage.
It doesn't have any relation to the stories of the characters.
°
The iconic Training Room stage born from the creators of the
M.U.G.E.N engine is a relatively simple stage that hasn't
visually changed since its initial conception, mostly being
comprised of a blue background and floor, with a lighter
blue chequered pattern overlaying them; the blue is actually
a colour gradient, as it gets darker as it reaches the top of
the screen (background) or as it reaches the background (floor).
°
Each of the three definitions come packaged separately with
a different version of M.U.G.E.N, though they can be
differentiated by the M.U.G.E.N 1.0 and M.U.G.E.N 1.1 variants
using an otherwise redundant localcoord value, and the 1.0 variant
having an internal name of 'Wasteland'.
°
Curiously, the stage isn't particularly wide, though this pales
in comparison to the stage's short height, where the camera
barely has to scroll much distance vertically before
it's prevented from going any further.
