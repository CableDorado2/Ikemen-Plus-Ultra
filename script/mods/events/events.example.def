 ____________________
/       EVENTS       \_____________________________________________________

Load event assets.
Event items added are displayed in: Extras - Events submenu.

Setup following parameters below "[Event <0...>]" section:

- id = text
Set to name that should be returned by GameMode trigger.
This parameter also initiates new events declaration, so it has to be
assigned before any other parameter used by the same event.
All events should have unique id names.

- info = text
Set the info text that should be displayed for an event unlocked.

- previewspr = <groupNo,indexNo>
Set groupNo and indexNo to read from sprite file defined in
"eventSpr" events.lua file, to show sprite preview for item.

- previewpos = <posX,posY>
Set posX and posY to sprite preview defined in "eventSpr" events.lua file.

- previewscale = <scaleX,scaleY>
Set scaleX and scaleY to sprite preview defined in "eventSpr" events.lua file.

- path = path.lua
Path to file with lua extension (relative to game directory)
containing event mode custom fight coded in Lua language.

- unlock
Pure Lua code, executed exactly as is, each time upon loading events menu
and after complete one. If it evaluates to boolean 'true' the event
will be selectable from events mode submenu, or locked on 'false'.
Default: true.
