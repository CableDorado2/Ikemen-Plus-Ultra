character = Kung Fu Man
bgm = sound/China.mp3
text:
Mayama Chan!
Really, thank you for helping me find Kung Fu Girl.
But this is something I have to solve myself.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Soo.. I can't allow you to come with me.

character = Mako Mayama
side = 2
text:
I could be of great help
haven't you asked?
_
Who took all Minions off your back?

character = Kung Fu Man
sfx = 1,2
text:
That's true. Hmm, how do you defeat all of them?
I mean, I don't see them anywhere..

character = Mako Mayama
side = 2
text:
It.. doesn't matter..
If what people say is true then..

character = Mako Mayama
side = 2
bgm = sound/system/Tower.mp3
text:
Suave Dude is the genius who is capable of
acquiring powers from other fighters
with a "device" that he himself developed.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Hmm, that's how he knew how to counter my attack..
SO, he's probably going to want extract
Kung Fu Girl's power?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
But there is something else.. they know each other.
For some reason Kung Fu Girl awakened a "trauma"
from her past..

character = Kung Fu Man

I need to find out what happened between they long
before I met her.

character = Mako Mayama
side = 2
sfx = 2,2

congratulations you have achieved your "Good Ending"!

character = Suave Dude

She doesn't exist, she's an "Illusion" created by me
to make an example of our story

Woah! save that last word for another
kind of ending buddy..

character = Suave Dude

Ehehehe, Ok. I'm sure you want to know
why she could imitate your techniques or
how I could build a clone of yours too fast..

character = Master Kung Fu Man
sfx = 1,5
text:
Speak!

character = Suave Dude
side = 2
sfx = 4,2
text:
It's easy... the world where we live is like
a "Micro-Matrix".. here it's possible to create
any fighter who can copy techniques from others.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
sfx = 1,2
text:
That's...impossible. I'm real and she must have
some innate talent or something similar..

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Otherwise.
Other fighters like her would have appeared sooner..

character = Suave Dude
side = 2
sfx = 4,1
text:
Well, believe it or not, she's already gone.
For some reason you managed to make my creation
interested in breaking his limits..

character = Master Kung Fu Man

Oh, you mean you don't know where she is?

character = Suave Dude
side = 2
sfx = 4,6
text:
Wait wait!, don't hit me again..
My bones already hurts.

She has gone to find more strength to show you what
she's capable of. That was the last thing she said..

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
All I want is to fix things with my Girlfriend

and this time return and live a normal life with her.

character = Suave Dude
side = 2
sfx = 4,1
text:
So I guess it's your responsibility now.
Well you've earned her, can I disappear now?

character = Master Kung Fu Man
sfx = 1,2
text:
I still don't quite understand what your goal is,
But I guess you have a way to track your "creation".

character = Master Kung Fu Man
bgm = sound/Training Room 2.mp3

You'll have to help me find her.

else

I won't let you leave this game..

text:
I see that you are already understanding this, hehe.
_
I warn you, this challenge will be
"the most difficult one" you can face.

character = Suave Dude
side = 2
text:
I mean, she's in something known as "Balance Field".
If you don't get there quickly she will become an
unrecognizable broken thing.
_
Because she was designed to avoid balance.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
How do I get there?

character = Suave Dude
side = 2
sfx = 4,2
text:
"Easy" as exceeding your limits so with that..
_
The "Divine Core" detects that you need a balance
and will teleports you to the "Balance Field".
